# Building and Evaluating AI PolicyChat 

## Background and Objectives
Our goal was to create an AI Policy Chatbot to answer AI policy questions. For this, we tested different approaches and picked the best: 
- LLaMA-7B and Chat (Pre-trained/vanilla)
- LLaMA-7B and Chat (Prompt-engineered)
- LLaMA-7B (Fine-tuned)

## Repository Structure
This repository contains the following files and directories:

- `final-presentation.pdf`: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for model building, including data acquisition, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `notebooks`: A folder with all notebooks including:
   - `notebooks`: 
- `demo`: A folder with videos demonstrating the performance of prompt-engineered and fine-tuned models.
- `final-report.pdf`: A detailed report in PDF format summarizing the approach, methodology, results, and insights from the analysis. 
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the contents of the repository.
