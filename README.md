# Building and Evaluating AI PolicyChat 

## Background and Objectives
Our goal was to create an AI Policy Chatbot to answer AI policy questions. For this, we tested different approaches and picked the best: 
- LLaMA-7B and Chat (Pre-trained/vanilla)
- LLaMA-7B and Chat (Prompt-engineered)
- LLaMA-7B (Fine-tuned)
